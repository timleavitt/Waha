### L
- **Language Instance**: A language in Waha that the user can install. The reason it's not just called a "Language" is because it's possible there will be multiple Language Instances of the same language. For instance, an English for the US and an English for the UK. The term "Language" is generally used in the app code to describe the language that the user's phone is set to.
